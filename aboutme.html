    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>When I was younger I usually tended to watch a ton of space/astronomy documentaries because they intregued me a lot. Ever since then that kind of influenced 
    what I've wanted over the past few years actually. It's so interesting to see how much we don't know about space, how we need to explore it in order to survive 
    as a species, and right now I live in the golden age just right when we are about to colonize and start civilizations on other celestial bodies.  </p>

    <p>I definetly want to be part of all of this so it's really important to learn the basics of how everyday technology actually works hence the reason why I'm 
    taking computer science at this high school. I'm also super envious of Tech giants and also some other people who influence with space exploration such as Elon 
    Musk who not only is in first in trying to colonize space but he also is a really good eantrupenur with technology and that made him a very important person in today's 
    world and also Jeff Bezos who also takes advantage of technology and makes literally as much as he can desire.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>In middle school when I was 13 years old, I went to some NASA camp and they teached me even more things that would make me even more envious and it also made me understand 
    way more about all of this. The past few years has been really rough on me but I also take advantage of the quote "take risks if there is a chance of success even at the slightest 
    and don't give up" in some TED talk I watched a few years ago so that's why I'm keeping my head up. </p>
    <hr>
    <p>In conclusion, I am very grateful for the opportunity to take computer science this year because if you think about it, technology will be mostly influencing our lives very soon 
    as if it doesn't now so it's really important to learn how everything all works even if it's just the basics. </p>
